The note about the original paper: [SSD: Single Shot MultiBox Detector](https://github.com/weiliu89/caffe/tree/ssd) can be found [here](http://blog.csdn.net/u010167269/article/details/52563573).

This practice is inspired by [ssd-plate_detection](https://github.com/hyh21521038/ssd-plate_detection), thanks to [solace_hyh](http://weibo.com/u/5745235949?is_all=1).

**The detail of the above code can read my blog**: http://blog.csdn.net/u010167269/article/details/52851667.

Meanwhile, I have uploaded my training caffemodel to WeiYun.
